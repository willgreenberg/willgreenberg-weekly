### Home-Assistant Progress

This week has been all about tidying up our third page submission and preparing for our presentation on May 1. The Home-Assistant maintainers have been wonderfully patient and helpful when it comes to working out the issues in the Light docs. There were some odd complexities with class inheritance for the Light entity in particular, but Luis worked it out and got it merged (our third merged PR!) Goes to show that this project was a great choice -- though the code base is huge and I would like to eventually contribute code, the maintainers have been grateful to us for writing docs. We're now exploring whether it would be viable to contribute another page before the end of the semester after we present on Wednesday. Looking forward to it!

My personal contributions this semester have included: breaking into the Home-Assistant community and directing our contribution plan, finding documentation that needed work, and finally writing the full documentation for the Climate entity and adding fixes to my partners' pages. I've had fun diving into the codebase, and by reading so much code I feel much more comfortable now with the structure and implementation of components in the project.
